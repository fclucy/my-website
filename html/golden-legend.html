            <h1> Consigned to the Procurers of the Town, She Proves Immovable</h1>
            <p>
                Then commanded Paschasius that the ribalds of the town should come, to whom he delivered St. Lucy,
                saying: Call other to you for to defoul her, and labour her so much till she be dead.
                Anon the ribalds would have drawn her from thence where she was, and have brought her to the bordel, but
                the Holy Ghost made her so pesant and heavy that in no wise might they move her from the place.
                Wherefore many of the servants of the judge put hand to, for to draw with the other, and she abode
                still. Then they bound cords to her hands and feet, and all drew, but she abode alway still as a
                mountain, without moving. Whereof Paschasius was all anguishous and angry, and did do call his
                enchanters, which might never move her for all enchantery. Then Paschasius did do yoke for her oxen
                many, for to draw her, and yet they might not move her from the place. Then Paschasius demanded her for
                what reason might it be that a frail maid might not be drawn ne moved by a thousand men.
                She said: It is the work of God, and if thou settest thereto yet ten thousand they should not move me.
                Of these words the judge was sore tormented, and St. Lucy said to him: Wherefore tormentest thou thyself
                thus? If thou hast proved and assayed that I am the temple of God, believe it. If thou hast not assayed,
                learn to assay.
