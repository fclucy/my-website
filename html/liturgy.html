                            For it is not the one who recommends himself who is approved,
                            but the one whom the Lord recommends.
        
                            If only you would put up with a little foolishness from me!
                            Please put up with me.
                            For I am jealous of you with the jealousy of God,
                            since I betrothed you to one husband
                            to present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.

                            This is the wise virgin, whom the Lord found waiting;
                            at his coming, she went in with him to the wedding feast.

                            Jesus told his disciples this parable:
                            "The Kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins
                            who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
                            Five of them were foolish and five were wise.
                            The foolish ones, when taking their lamps,
                            brought no oil with them,
                            but the wise brought flasks of oil with their lamps.
                            Since the bridegroom was long delayed,
                            they all became drowsy and fell asleep.
                            At midnight, there was a cry,
                            'Behold, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!'
                            Then all those virgins got up and trimmed their lamps.
                            The foolish ones said to the wise,
                            'Give us some of your oil,
                            for our lamps are going out.'
                            But the wise ones replied,
                            'No, for there may not be enough for us and you.
                            Go instead to the merchants and buy some for yourselves.'
                            While they went off to buy it,
                            the bridegroom came
                            and those who were ready went into the wedding feast with him.
                            Then the door was locked.
                            Afterwards the other virgins came and said,
                            'Lord, Lord, open the door for us!'
                            But he said in reply,
                            'Amen, I say to you, I do not know you.'
                            Therefore, stay awake,
                            for you know neither the day nor the hour."
