                <p>
                    Lucy was a 6 year old girl from Bellingham, WA, who died from
                    pediatric brain stem cancer. She is just one of countless little flowers
                    I have collected while researching the lives of youth who have
                    died tragically in our local area. Lucy is a very special name in the Catholic church,
                    as Lucy is one of the saints referenced in Eucharistic Prayer I, a liturgy
                    recited daily in Catholic masses all over the world. It is not an exaggeration
                    to say that the sun never sets on Saint Lucy, or for that matter,
                    any of the little angels like Lucy Jane Duersch who now rest with Jesus in the Heavenly Kingdom. May this tribute serve as an example of how technology and the Internet can and should be used for good, to honor the smallest, least, and too often forgotten among us. Even if it seems like the world has moved on and forgotten all about these children, make no mistake, its these souls Jesus is going to remember the most. Amen.
