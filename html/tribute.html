                <p>
                    Lucy was a 6 year old girl from Bellingham, WA, who died from
                    pediatric brain stem cancer. She is just one of countless little flowers
                    I have collected while researching the lives of youth who have
                    died tragically in our local area. Lucy is a very special name in the Catholic church,
                    as Lucy is one of the saints referenced in Eucharistic Prayer I, a liturgy
                    recited daily in Catholic masses all over the world. It is not an exaggeration
                    to say that the sun never sets on Saint Lucy, or for that matter,
                    any of the little angels like Lucy Jane Duersch who now rest with Jesus in the Heavenly Kingdom. May this tribute serve as an example of how technology and the Internet can and should be used for good, to honor the smallest, least, and too often forgotten among us. Even if it seems like the world has moved on and forgotten all about these children, make no mistake, its these souls Jesus is going to remember the most. Amen.

                <p>
                    There's no curtain call<br>
                    And there's no point in life at all<br>
                    If each day ends and this bent heart of mine cannot heal<br>
                    I can't see a darn thing but could it be<br>
                    That the gray clouds that I loved completely blinded me<br><br>

                    They're souls like me and you<br>
                    Who aren't aware of what they do<br>
                    Always laughing in the face of danger and truth<br>
                    Can't they see<br>
                    Beyond their hazy glee? <br>
                    That nothing good comes of rushing in blindly<br><br>

                    I'll keep moving on<br>
                    No matter what may come my way<br>
                    And I'll sing, not fearing what they say<br><br>

                    Deep in my heart I know somehow<br>
                    That you are hurt, feel insecure<br>
                    And surly crying because you are only human<br><br>

                    These tears of mine are screaming out: "It's not a lie"<br>
                    And as I cry I want to thank you<br>
                    For showing me what I could be<br>
                    I thank you so<br>
                    For this miracle. <br><br>

                    Try with all your might but dreams only live in the night<br>
                    I'm so tired of them always being out of reach<br><br>

                    We don't realize that the defeat's a disguise<br>
                    Our fighting spirit is the flame of our souls<br><br>

                    So I'll wait by that door<br>
                    No matter what may come my way<br>
                    And holding out my hand, I will say<br><br>

                    If you are crushed - If you are hurt<br>
                    Here is the strength and the confidence you have misplaced<br>
                    If you feel down, listen for my song<br><br>

                    These tears of mine are screaming out<br>
                    I found you on this gray world without any blue<br>
                    But you showed me every color<br>
                    I'll hold your hand and won't let go<br>
                    You're my miracle.
