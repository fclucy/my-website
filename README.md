# Website Critique #2 - Ky Simpson
# On your Liturgy page the images are different width sizes, the PARABLE OF THE TEN VIRGINS one is the most noticable maybe it can be sized down a bit.

# Response #1 - Ky Simpson
# styles.css - line 5
# styles.css - line 95
# I added a line to the img selector on styles.css so that the image width is now uniform across web pages with a viewport width relative dimension. Since this looked aesthetically unpleasing for RWD on mobile screens, I added an alternate viewport width relative dimension if the screen is smaller than a desktop.

# Website Critique #3 - Ky Simpson
# The text on the Liturgy page also looks a bit off, like each section is going to run into the next, I think maybe some boxes around the text would help this issue.

# Respone #2 - Ky Simpson
# I decided to address this issue by putting the liturgy into a table, combining the need for boxes around the text with extra credit for introducing tables into the website design.

# Extra Credit #1 - add favicon
# index.html - line 9
# golden-legend.html - line 10
# liturgy.html - line 10
# sacred-tradition - line 10

# Extra Credit #2 - add table
# liturgy.html - lines 31-53
# liturgy.css - lines 43-139
